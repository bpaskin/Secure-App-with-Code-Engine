# Securing an application using IBM Code Engine and Cloud App ID

With IBM [Code Engine](https://www.ibm.com/products/code-engine) the communications from the endpoint to the pod are encrypted with SSL encryption.  An [Istio](https://istio.io) container is injected into the pod as a sidecar and then the relevant information is passed to the application container.  Applications that want authentication and authorization can implement it themselves.  This examples shows setting up a Liberty web application that interactions with IBM [Cloud App ID](https://www.ibm.com/products/app-id) using [OAuth](https://oauth.net) to authentice users, though it can be any method, like DB or file store, etc.  IBM Cloud App ID does offer other methods to [secure applications](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-adding-overview) at a higer level, like at the Istio or network ingress level.

----
## Getting started

1. An [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login) is required.  Signup is free, and the example can run for free too using the Code Engine free tier.
2. The [IBM Cloud CLI](https://www.ibm.com/products/cli) needs to be downloaded and installed on your system.
3. The Code Engine and Countainer registry plugins for the CLI need to be installed.
```
ibmcloud plugin install code-engine
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
```
---
## Creating the necessary resources
1. Logon to the IBM Cloud
```
ibmcloud login -u <username>
```
2. List resource groups
```
ibmcloud resource groups
```
3. Choose one of the resource groups fromt he last command
```
ibmcloud target -g <resource group>
```
4. List available regions
```
ibmcloud regions
```
5. Select a region to host the Code Engine project and resources
```
ibmcloud target -r <region name>
```
---
## Code Engine Time
1.  Create a Code Engine project
```
ibmcloud ce project create --name Secure
```
2. Select the project to use
```
ibmcloud ce project select --name Secure
```
3. Deploy the application by using the Dockerfile.  You may have to add the CE_HOST information later
```
ibmcloud ce app create --name secure --build-source https://github.com/bpaskin/Secure-App-with-Code-Engine.git --build-context-dir . -e CE_HOST=secure.<identfier.region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
```
4. Using your browser test the application
```
 https://secure.<from listing>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
```

## Setup Cloud App ID
1. Logon to the IBM Cloud, Select the hamburder menu in the top left and then select `Browser all services...` from the list.

2. Select the App ID square from the available services

3. If there is currently no instance available, select the Lite plan, check the terms and conditions box and hit the `create` button

4. Download the sample program

5. Select the Java program so it create an application automatically for you, otherwise you will need to add an application later and chaneg the Liberty configuration

6. From the main page select `Manage Authentication` from the list, and keep only the `Cloud Directory` enabled.

7. Click on the `Authentication settings` tab and add the URL that was given to you for the deployed secure application and add a `/*` at the end.
```
(i.e., https://secure.<identfier.region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud/*
```

8. test you application!
